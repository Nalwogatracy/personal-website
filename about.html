    Is there anything new that you would wish to get to know about me,if yes lets follow and enjoy for more,don't forget to share and save other people's lives.
    <p>Here is some of the data that talks about me</p>
    <p>My name is Nalwoga Tracy,a female by gender,a young adult by age a muganda by tribe and a Ugandan by nationality.
        The most interesting thing about me is that I am so jolly and welcoming and yet when i get angry you wouldn't wish to come near me coz I'm so hostile just like the Masai
        I hate familiarity and one thing that can fume me is taking me for granted and lying to me,a wise man once said "A thief doesn't want to be stolen" And that exactly works directly with me.
